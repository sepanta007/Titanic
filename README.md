## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). The goal of the project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Project structure

- **gender_submission.csv** : A sample submission file provided by Kaggle to demonstrate the expected format for submissions.
- **my_analysis.ipynb** : Jupyter notebook containing in-depth analysis and exploration of the Titanic dataset. This notebook covers data exploration, visualizations, and any insights gained from the analysis.
- **predictions.csv** : The file containing the predictions generated by the machine learning model on the test dataset.
- **test.csv** : The test dataset for the competition, used for evaluating the machine learning model.
- **train.csv** : The training dataset for the competition, used for building and training the machine learning model.

## Analysis

The primary analysis is documented in the `my_analysis.ipynb` notebook. Explore this notebook for detailed insights into the dataset, visualizations, and any preprocessing steps taken.

## Predictions

The machine learning model's predictions on the test dataset can be found in the `predictions.csv` file.

## Results

The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of **78.229%** on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting survival outcomes. Further details about model evaluation metrics.
